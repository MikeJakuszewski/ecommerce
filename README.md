## Documentation for How to Contribute Using Git

1. Clone the repository with this command if you don't have it:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/kbventures/ecommerce.git
   ```

2. Run the following command to make sure you have the latest main branch

   ```shell
   git pull
   ```

3. Create a new feature branch with a descriptive name and only make your feature changes here. For example, to add documentation for contributing I would call this branch `add-git-workflow`.

   ```shell
   git checkout -b <your feature branch name>
   ```

4. Make as many changes as you need in your feature branch. You can use the following commands per commit message.

   ```shell
   git add .
   git status
   git commit -m <your commit message>
   ```

5. Once your feature is ready and you're ready to merge into the main branch first make sure to push your local branch changes to GitHub's computers.

   ```shell
   git push â€“set-upstream origin <your feature branch name>
   ```

6. Go to https://github.com/kbventures/ecommerce/branches and you should see your newly pushed feature branch.
